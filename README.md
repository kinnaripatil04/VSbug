# VS Bug
Open Source Visual Studio Enhancement Project

The VS code offers shortcuts for various tag in HTML. If we type exclamatory (“!”) into an HTML file in VS Code and then press Tab we will get the basic HTML skeleton. The skeleton has a lot of frequently used tags missing from the boilerplate such as <link> tag and HTML is incomplete without CSS. The developers need to write the frequently used tag again and again whenever required. To save the time of the coder as well as to ease their work, there must be a new short-cut that has a different skeleton with all frequently used tags such as link tags,javascript tag, main tag etc. With this developer has to only type the new short cut i.e("!") and he/she will be provided with new skelton.
